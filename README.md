# collaborative_robotic_vehicles

The purpose of this diploma thesis is to design and simulate two collaborative robotic vehicles equipped with visual sensors for optimal coverage of an unknown planar space. The robotâ€™s trajectory is obtained by wheel encoders, but also a visual odometry study using optical flow was developed. The depth of the obstacles was computed using the geometric characteristics of the pinhole camera and mapping was possible through the Recursive Bayesian Estimation. Moreover, two path planning algorithms were developed, A* and Artificial Potential Fields, as well as a controller for producing the robot speeds to follow the generated path and achieve the target position. The communication between the robots was achieved via Bluetooth to collaborate during mapping. Lastly, the experiments were simulated in Webots to determine the accuracy of the odometry, the mapping algorithm of one vehicle and the collaborative mapping of two vehicles.
